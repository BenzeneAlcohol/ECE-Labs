Q1 

a) 12.2 Volts because Vaverage = 0.637 Vmax, hence Vmax has to be 0.637 for Vavg to be 8V

b) It will decrease

c) Vrms = Vmax/root 2 = 8.62V

d) Ripple factor = 0.482

e) 

f)pic

f) 

g)

h)



Q2)

We can see clearly that the output waveform looks very similar to that of a DC waveform. It still has some small variations, but its peak is very little and it resembles that of a DC output.
